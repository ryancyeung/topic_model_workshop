I don't think I've ever seen so much helpfulness and friendliness on the internet before and I just want to say thank you. I think I still have a long way to go, maybe these thought's will never disappear but today has been the best day since they began and it's in a large part due to the people who spoke on this thread. I've read every post here and will keep reading them. In short just thank you, everyone.""]"

Abusers spend so long abusing and being nice and abusing and being nice that you start to think that you play a role in the abuse and the only reason he/she is nice to you again is because of some demand you met. And your will to live/be safe/feel secure will override any trauma you have been through. You will do anything to make them nice again, because that means you get to be safe/secure.

We hear all about the men who financially abuse their partners by prohibiting them from having a job, or denying them access to bank accounts, and that sort of thing. There\'s also the side where they monitor every account and become completely terrifying if their higher earning partner so much as buys one cup of coffee that they didn\'t approve of. They spend all her money on random crap that they can pass off as household expenses.', 'So often I feel like posting something personal, even a ""me too"" sort of comment on social media, relating to the abuse I went through when I was married (divorced 2 years now and moved far away), but every time I hold back because we have many friends in common, and I feel like speaking about my experiences would come across as badmouthing him in a public way and airing dirty laundry. I\'ll talk to people about it in person, or other private way, any time. I wish I felt like I could be more open about it. When I do make a post, like for domestic violence awareness month, I make it seem like I\'m just posting in general, not necessarily about my own life, for example. But it all still feels like when I had to be so secretive about so many things, because he was so controlling.']"
